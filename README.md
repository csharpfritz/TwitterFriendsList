# TwitterFriendsList
This is a simple web application that will allow you to create a private twitter list that contains the list of friends that another Twitter account follows.

Example:

Jeff creates a private list that contains the Twitter users that Sally follows.  In this way, Jeff can review that list and see what Twitter looks like to Sally.
